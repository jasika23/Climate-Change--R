This project analyzes and forecasts global land temperature anomalies from 1850 to 2023 using ARIMA modeling techniques in R. The dataset is sourced from the NOAA National Centers for Environmental Information.

Project Overview
Aim: To analyze yearly global land temperature anomalies and develop ARIMA models for forecasting future temperature variations.
Data: Yearly temperature anomalies from 1850 to 2023, referenced to the period 1901-2000.
Conclusion
In this assignment, our primary objective was to conduct a comprehensive analysis of the Global Land Temperature Anomalies dataset spanning from 1850 to 2023. Our aim was to develop ARIMA models for forecasting future temperature variations. After conducting thorough tests, our best model was identified as ARIMA (1,1,3). This model was selected based on rigorous analysis, model specification, parameter estimation, and model evaluation using diagnostic tools like AIC and BIC. Through rigorous analysis and model selection, we aimed to provide reliable forecasts for future temperature anomalies.

Key Highlights
Descriptive Analysis: Characterized temporal patterns, trends, and variability in the dataset.
Model Specification: Proposed potential ARIMA models using ACF and PACF analysis.
Data Transformation: Applied Box-Cox transformation and differencing to address non-normality and non-stationarity.
Model Evaluation: Used AIC and BIC for selecting the best-fitting ARIMA model.
This project demonstrates the application of time series analysis and ARIMA modeling in climate science, providing valuable insights for forecasting and understanding global temperature variations.
